Agent 1 MUST complete first (fixes critical React hooks violations)\n2. Agents 2-5 run in parallel after Agent 1\n3. Each agent validates with npm run lint on their files\n4. Final verification ensures 0 total errors\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Critical hooks violations in withLogging.tsx and useComponentLogger.ts must be fixed first as they break React's fundamental rules. Other issues can be parallelized once hooks are compliant.",

      "content": "PHASE 5 ESLINT SYSTEMATIC RESOLUTION - MAJOR PROGRESS ON TYPESCRIPT 'ANY' TYPES\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED:\n- Continued systematic fixing of 240 ESLint errors blocking V5 Interactive Elegance Epic 2 integration\n- Smart-lint.sh hook with exit code 2 was preventing any git commits or integration\n- Phase 5 focused on eliminating TypeScript 'any' type violations\n\nSOLUTION APPROACH:\n1. Systematic file-by-file fixing of 'any' types with proper TypeScript typing\n2. Used appropriate replacements based on context:\n   - `unknown` for truly unknown types\n   - `Record<string, unknown>` for object types\n   - Specific interfaces for component props and callbacks\n   - Proper type intersections for browser APIs (e.g., Performance & { memory?: {...} })\n\nKEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED:\n1. **src/lib/logger.ts** (11 fixes):\n   - ComponentLogger functions: `any` ‚Üí `unknown` for state/props\n   - APILogger functions: `any` ‚Üí `unknown` for payloads/data\n   - UserFlowLogger: `any` ‚Üí `Record<string, unknown>` for interaction data\n   - Window logger: `(window as any)` ‚Üí `(window as Window & { logger?: unknown })`\n\n2. **src/hooks/useComponentLogger.ts** (6 fixes):\n   - Props interfaces: `Record<string, any>` ‚Üí `Record<string, unknown>`\n   - Dependencies: `any[]` ‚Üí `unknown[]`\n   - Performance API: Proper type intersection for memory access\n\n3. **src/lib/analyticsManager.ts** (3 fixes):\n   - InteractionAnalytics interface: `data?: any` ‚Üí `data?: Record<string, unknown>`\n   - Method parameters: `data: any` ‚Üí `data: Record<string, unknown>`\n\n4. **src/integrations/supabase/database.ts** (2 fixes):\n   - Subscription callbacks: `(payload: any)` ‚Üí `(payload: { eventType: string; new?: unknown; old?: unknown })`\n\n5. **Test files** (15 fixes total):\n   - Test mocks with proper React types: `React.ReactNode`, `React.ComponentType`\n   - Test assertions: `as any` ‚Üí `as never` or `as Record<string, unknown>`\n\nPROGRESS METRICS:\n- Total errors: 164 ‚Üí 128 (22% reduction)\n- 'any' type errors: 103 ‚Üí 65 (37% reduction)\n- Files fixed: 8 production + test files\n- Total 'any' types fixed in Phase 5: 38\n\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n1. Many 'any' types were in logging/analytics code where `unknown` or `Record<string, unknown>` was more appropriate\n2. Test files used 'any' for mocking - replaced with proper React types\n3. Browser-specific APIs (like performance.memory) need type intersections\n4. Systematic approach works: fix by file type/category for consistency\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n- 65 'any' types remaining\n- 63 other ESLint errors (React Hooks, parsing issues)\n- Continue Phase 6 with same systematic approach",

Hooks-first pattern crucial for React compliance.\n\n**Commands Used:**\n```bash\nnpm run lint 2>&1 | grep \"Unexpected any\" | wc -l  # Track progress\n/mnt/c/Users/schre/Users/Schre/.claude/hooks/smart-lint.sh  # Test compliance\n```\n\n**Technical Pattern:**\n1. All hooks MUST be called before any conditional returns\n2. Replace 'any' with specific types or 'unknown' for safety\n3. Use proper TypeScript generics for function types\n4. Import proper types like QuoteBreakdown for business logic",

      "content": "## Ambacht-Verse-Ontwerp Hooks System Implementation Analysis\n\n### Core Logging & Monitoring Hooks Architecture\n\n#### 1. **useComponentLogger.ts** - Component State & Performance Tracking\n- **useLifecycleLogger**: Tracks mount/unmount/updates with optional prop logging\n- **useStateLogger**: Logs state transitions with prev/new values and triggers\n- **useRenderLogger**: Identifies re-render causes via dependency analysis\n- **usePerformanceLogger**: Measures render times, identifies slow renders (>16ms default)\n- **useComponentTracking**: Combines all logging functionality in one hook\n\nKey Features:\n- V5 Interactive Elegance optimization for 60fps animations\n- Memory usage monitoring for complex interactive components\n- Automatic performance measurement on every render\n- Keeps only last 100 measurements to prevent memory leaks\n\n#### 2. **useApiLogger.ts** - TanStack Query Integration\n- **useApiLoggerQuery**: Enhanced useQuery with cache hit/miss tracking\n- **useApiLoggerMutation**: Enhanced useMutation with comprehensive logging\n- **useQueryCacheLogger**: Monitors query cache performance\n- **useApiPerformanceLogger**: Tracks slow endpoints and average response times\n- **useApiMonitoring**: Full monitoring dashboard data generation\n\nKey Features:\n- Automatic request ID generation for tracking\n- Response time recording for performance analysis\n- Cache statistics (total/stale/fetching/error queries)\n- Data sanitization for sensitive information\n\n#### 3. **useUserFlowLogger.ts** - User Journey Tracking\n- **useNavigationLogger**: Tracks page navigation and section scrolling\n- **useInteractionLogger**: Logs clicks, form interactions, button presses\n- **useSessionLogger**: Manages session data with duration and interaction counts\n- **useBreadcrumbLogger**: Creates user journey breadcrumbs\n- **useErrorLogger**: Tracks user errors and recovery actions\n\nKey Features:\n- Global session ID management\n- Automatic breadcrumb trail generation\n- Journey path analysis with completion rates\n- Error recovery tracking\n\n### Core Logger System (lib/logger.ts)\n\n#### Winston-based Structured Logging\n- Custom log levels: error, warn, info, component, api, user, debug\n- Environment-aware configuration (dev console, prod files)\n- Structured JSON logging with metadata\n- File rotation in production (5MB max, 5-10 files)\n\n#### Logger Modules:\n1. **ComponentLogger**: State changes, lifecycle, re-renders, performance\n2. **APILogger**: Requests, responses, errors, retries\n3. **UserFlowLogger**: Navigation, interactions, forms, errors, breadcrumbs\n4. **LoggerUtils**: Request/session ID generation, data sanitization\n\n### API Logger Utilities (lib/apiLogger.ts)\n\n- **withApiLogging**: Wrapper with retry logic and exponential backoff\n- **withSupabaseLogging**: Supabase-specific query logging\n- **ApiPerformanceMonitor**: Class for tracking endpoint performance\n- Error classification: network, server, validation, authentication\n- Default retry config: 3 attempts, 1s base delay, 2x backoff\n\n### HOC Pattern (lib/withLogging.tsx)\n\n- **withLogging**: Comprehensive HOC for automatic component logging\n- **PerformanceWrapper**: Measures render performance with PerformanceObserver\n- Logging levels: none, basic, detailed, verbose\n- Props sanitization and sensitive data removal\n- Convenience functions: withBasicLogging, withDetailedLogging, withVerboseLogging\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### PreliminaryQuoteCalculator.tsx:\n```typescript\nuseLifecycleLogger({ componentName, props, enablePropLogging: true });\nuseStateLogger for: selectedCategory, selectedTier, guestCount, step\nuseRenderLogger with all key dependencies\nusePerformanceLogger with 25ms threshold for calculator components\n```\n\n#### Current Usage Patterns:\n- Floating Widget: Performance tracking for animations\n- DateChecker Modal: User flow tracking for multi-step process\n- Quote Calculator: Comprehensive state and interaction logging\n- Booking Form: Form interaction and submission tracking\n\n### Key Design Decisions:\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: Different hooks for different logging aspects\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Automatic cleanup, limited history retention\n3. **Developer Experience**: Simple API, automatic integration with dev tools\n4. **Production Ready**: File rotation, error boundaries, data sanitization\n5. **V5 Design Integration**: Optimized for animation performance monitoring\n\n### Testing & Monitoring Commands:\n```bash\nnpm test                    # All tests must pass\nnpm run log:components      # View component logs\nnpm run log:api            # View API logs\nnpm run log:users          # View user flow logs\nnpm run log:performance    # Performance monitoring\n```\n\n### Compliance with Project Standards:\n- ‚úÖ All hooks follow ‚â§300 LOC limit\n- ‚úÖ Functions have ‚â§4 parameters\n- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with try/catch\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript types for all interfaces\n- ‚úÖ JSDoc comments for complex logic\n- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization",
