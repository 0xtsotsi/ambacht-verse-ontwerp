      "content": "## Ambacht-Verse-Ontwerp Hooks System Implementation Analysis\n\n### Core Logging & Monitoring Hooks Architecture\n\n#### 1. **useComponentLogger.ts** - Component State & Performance Tracking\n- **useLifecycleLogger**: Tracks mount/unmount/updates with optional prop logging\n- **useStateLogger**: Logs state transitions with prev/new values and triggers\n- **useRenderLogger**: Identifies re-render causes via dependency analysis\n- **usePerformanceLogger**: Measures render times, identifies slow renders (>16ms default)\n- **useComponentTracking**: Combines all logging functionality in one hook\n\nKey Features:\n- V5 Interactive Elegance optimization for 60fps animations\n- Memory usage monitoring for complex interactive components\n- Automatic performance measurement on every render\n- Keeps only last 100 measurements to prevent memory leaks\n\n#### 2. **useApiLogger.ts** - TanStack Query Integration\n- **useApiLoggerQuery**: Enhanced useQuery with cache hit/miss tracking\n- **useApiLoggerMutation**: Enhanced useMutation with comprehensive logging\n- **useQueryCacheLogger**: Monitors query cache performance\n- **useApiPerformanceLogger**: Tracks slow endpoints and average response times\n- **useApiMonitoring**: Full monitoring dashboard data generation\n\nKey Features:\n- Automatic request ID generation for tracking\n- Response time recording for performance analysis\n- Cache statistics (total/stale/fetching/error queries)\n- Data sanitization for sensitive information\n\n#### 3. **useUserFlowLogger.ts** - User Journey Tracking\n- **useNavigationLogger**: Tracks page navigation and section scrolling\n- **useInteractionLogger**: Logs clicks, form interactions, button presses\n- **useSessionLogger**: Manages session data with duration and interaction counts\n- **useBreadcrumbLogger**: Creates user journey breadcrumbs\n- **useErrorLogger**: Tracks user errors and recovery actions\n\nKey Features:\n- Global session ID management\n- Automatic breadcrumb trail generation\n- Journey path analysis with completion rates\n- Error recovery tracking\n\n### Core Logger System (lib/logger.ts)\n\n#### Winston-based Structured Logging\n- Custom log levels: error, warn, info, component, api, user, debug\n- Environment-aware configuration (dev console, prod files)\n- Structured JSON logging with metadata\n- File rotation in production (5MB max, 5-10 files)\n\n#### Logger Modules:\n1. **ComponentLogger**: State changes, lifecycle, re-renders, performance\n2. **APILogger**: Requests, responses, errors, retries\n3. **UserFlowLogger**: Navigation, interactions, forms, errors, breadcrumbs\n4. **LoggerUtils**: Request/session ID generation, data sanitization\n\n### API Logger Utilities (lib/apiLogger.ts)\n\n- **withApiLogging**: Wrapper with retry logic and exponential backoff\n- **withSupabaseLogging**: Supabase-specific query logging\n- **ApiPerformanceMonitor**: Class for tracking endpoint performance\n- Error classification: network, server, validation, authentication\n- Default retry config: 3 attempts, 1s base delay, 2x backoff\n\n### HOC Pattern (lib/withLogging.tsx)\n\n- **withLogging**: Comprehensive HOC for automatic component logging\n- **PerformanceWrapper**: Measures render performance with PerformanceObserver\n- Logging levels: none, basic, detailed, verbose\n- Props sanitization and sensitive data removal\n- Convenience functions: withBasicLogging, withDetailedLogging, withVerboseLogging\n\n### Implementation Examples\n\n#### PreliminaryQuoteCalculator.tsx:\n```typescript\nuseLifecycleLogger({ componentName, props, enablePropLogging: true });\nuseStateLogger for: selectedCategory, selectedTier, guestCount, step\nuseRenderLogger with all key dependencies\nusePerformanceLogger with 25ms threshold for calculator components\n```\n\n#### Current Usage Patterns:\n- Floating Widget: Performance tracking for animations\n- DateChecker Modal: User flow tracking for multi-step process\n- Quote Calculator: Comprehensive state and interaction logging\n- Booking Form: Form interaction and submission tracking\n\n### Key Design Decisions:\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: Different hooks for different logging aspects\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Automatic cleanup, limited history retention\n3. **Developer Experience**: Simple API, automatic integration with dev tools\n4. **Production Ready**: File rotation, error boundaries, data sanitization\n5. **V5 Design Integration**: Optimized for animation performance monitoring\n\n### Testing & Monitoring Commands:\n```bash\nnpm test                    # All tests must pass\nnpm run log:components      # View component logs\nnpm run log:api            # View API logs\nnpm run log:users          # View user flow logs\nnpm run log:performance    # Performance monitoring\n```\n\n### Compliance with Project Standards:\n- ‚úÖ All hooks follow ‚â§300 LOC limit\n- ‚úÖ Functions have ‚â§4 parameters\n- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with try/catch\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript types for all interfaces\n- ‚úÖ JSDoc comments for complex logic\n- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization",
