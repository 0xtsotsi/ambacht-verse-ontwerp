## Dutch Cultural Psychology Research

### Trust-Building Patterns in Netherlands Market
1. **Directness is Valued**: "Vanaf ‚Ç¨12.50 per persoon" more trusted than "Competitive pricing"
2. **No-Nonsense Approach**: Clear service levels without sales language
3. **Social Proof Important**: Other Dutch companies' testimonials carry weight
4. **Quality over Flash**: Substance valued over marketing polish

### Pricing Presentation Preferences
- **Format**: "Vanaf ‚Ç¨X per persoon" (From ‚Ç¨X per person)
- **Structure**: 3-tier system (Basis, Premium, Luxe) familiar and trusted
- **Inclusions**: Explicit list of what's included/excluded
- **Add-ons**: Optional services clearly separated from base price

## Emotional Journey Mapping - Pricing Cards

### Before Interaction
- **Budget Anxiety**: "Will this be affordable for my event?"
- **Comparison Shopping**: "How does this compare to other caterers?"
- **Decision Pressure**: "I need to decide quickly for my date"

### During Interaction
- **Relief**: "I can see actual prices!"
- **Confidence**: "This feels honest and professional"
- **Control**: "I understand my options clearly"
- **Calculation**: "I can estimate my total cost"

### After Interaction
- **Trust**: "They're transparent about costs"
- **Readiness**: "I'm prepared to book/contact them"
- **Advocacy**: "I'd recommend this transparency to others"

## Design Implications for Pricing Cards

### Visual Design Psychology
- **Colors**: Use sopranos-gold (#CC5D00) for pricing to create premium association
- **Typography**: Clear, readable numbers with Baskerville for elegance
- **Spacing**: Generous white space to avoid overwhelming feeling
- **Icons**: Dutch cultural symbols (local ingredients, craftsmanship)

### Information Architecture
- **Primary Focus**: Per-person price prominently displayed
- **Secondary Info**: Service description and key inclusions
- **Tertiary Details**: Add-ons and customization options
- **Call-to-Action**: Direct to booking with service pre-selected

### Dutch Language Considerations
- **Formal Tone**: Use "u/uw" forms for business context
- **Pricing Language**: "Vanaf" (from), "inclusief" (including), "per persoon"
- **Service Terms**: "Catering", "arrangement", "event"
- **Trust Language**: "transparant", "eerlijk", "duidelijk"
