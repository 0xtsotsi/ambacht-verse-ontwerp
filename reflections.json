      "assessmentProvided": "**BRUTAL HONESTY: We've Lost the Plot**\n\n**Critical Issues (Showstoppers):**\n1. **Scope Creep Insanity**: A simple catering website has become a full-stack enterprise application with TaskMaster, Notion APIs, complex build systems, multiple animation frameworks, and \"Interactive Elegance\" buzzword engineering\n2. **Over-Engineering Death Spiral**: We're building NASA-grade infrastructure for a local business that needs a contact form and pricing calculator\n3. **WSL Performance Theater**: Spending cycles optimizing Windows development environment instead of delivering business value\n4. **Testing Overkill**: Playwright, Vitest, accessibility testing, performance monitoring for what should be a static site with contact forms\n5. **Technical Debt Factory**: Every \"solution\" introduces 3 new problems requiring more tooling\n\n**Acceptable Issues:**\n- React/TypeScript stack (reasonable for modern web)\n- Basic component structure (standard practice)\n\n**The Brutal Truth**: \nWe're building a monument to our own cleverness instead of solving the client's actual problem. A catering business needs:\n- Clear pricing information\n- Easy contact/booking process  \n- Professional presentation\n- Fast loading times\n- Mobile responsiveness\n\nThey got:\n- A development workflow requiring WSL, Docker, multiple package managers\n- Database integrations for a business that probably tracks bookings in Excel\n- Animation systems more complex than Netflix's UI\n- AI task management for a website that should have been done in a weekend\n\n**What They Actually Asked For**: A professional catering website with booking capabilities and pricing transparency. What we built: A tech demo disguised as a business solution.\n\n**Endpoint Decision**: This is NOT at acceptable quality level. We've prioritized developer experience over business needs and created a maintenance nightmare for a simple business website.",
