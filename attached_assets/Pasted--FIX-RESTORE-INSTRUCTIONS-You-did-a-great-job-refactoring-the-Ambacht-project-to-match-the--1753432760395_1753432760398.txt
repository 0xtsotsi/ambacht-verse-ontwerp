# 🔁 FIX & RESTORE INSTRUCTIONS

You did a great job refactoring the Ambacht project to match the Soprano’s design system — but now please make the following precise corrections:

---

## ✅ 1. Restore the Dynamic Booking System:

> ⚠️ You removed the original dynamic booking/reservation form component (used to fetch or process real bookings). This must be restored.

- Reintegrate the original booking logic (if in separate component like `BookingForm.jsx` or `Boeking.vue`)
- Ensure the button “Reserveer Vandaag” links directly to or opens the dynamic booking modal or form
- Booking form must retain all dynamic fields and submission logic (if present in original version)
- Ensure it uses updated Soprano-style styles, but retains backend connection or JS logic

## 🎨 2. Correct Font Sizes and Visual Hierarchy:

> ⚠️ Current font sizes are inconsistent and do not follow proper hierarchy.

Use the following font scale via Tailwind:

```js
// Headings:
text-5xl font-semibold leading-tight      // Hero or primary
text-3xl font-medium leading-snug         // Section titles
text-xl font-normal leading-relaxed       // Subheaders

// Body:
text-base font-normal leading-loose       // Main text
text-sm text-muted-foreground             // Small text or details
Ensure all major sections follow this hierarchy consistently:

Header navigation = text-base font-medium

Pricing titles = text-2xl font-semibold

CTA text = text-lg font-bold

Footer = text-sm text-muted-foreground

🚫 3. Remove All Emojis:
⚠️ Emojis were added into section titles and descriptions — remove them all for visual clarity and professionalism.

“📂 PROJECT TO EDIT” → just “Project to edit”

“🎯 OBJECTIVE” → “Objective”

“🍝”, “🧁” etc → remove entirely from code comments, headings, and text content

Keep the tone clean, structured, and elegant — no icons or emoji required.

🔄 4. Maintain Sopranos Layout but Fix These:
Ensure all CTA buttons still follow Soprano layout but lead to the restored booking system

Do not remove working logic when changing visual structure

Retain Tailwind color tokens from previous instruction (F9F6F1 background, E86C32 accent, etc.)

✅ Summary
You must preserve all functional parts of the original Ambacht site (esp. booking system), while keeping the visual refactor clean, elegant, and consistent with Soprano style.

Focus on:

Font scale and structure

Functional restoration (booking)

Visual consistency

Professional tone (remove emojis)

DO NOT DELETE functional features when refactoring.
