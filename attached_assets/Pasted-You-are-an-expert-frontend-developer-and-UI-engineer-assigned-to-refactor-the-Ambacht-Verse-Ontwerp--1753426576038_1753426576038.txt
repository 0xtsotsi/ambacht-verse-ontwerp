You are an expert frontend developer and UI engineer assigned to refactor the Ambacht-Verse-Ontwerp GitHub Project to fully adopt the layout, visual language, and interaction principles of:

🧁 The Julienne Cooking App (iOS) — clean, elegant, warm, componentized

🍝 The Soprano's Catering Website — festive, well-structured, brand-forward

Your mission is to make Wesley’s Ambacht website match these two sources visually, structurally, and emotionally. The goal is a beautiful, professional, and emotionally engaging catering brand site that feels delightful and artisanal.

🧾 Your Requirements
Refer to the README.md (titled: Ambacht Ui Refactor) for:

🎨 Color system: drop the old Ambacht palette and apply Julienne + Sopranos colors (backgrounds, accent orange, gold highlights, cream cards)

✍️ Typography: Implement Inter or SF Display with clean heading/body/small scale using Tailwind

🧩 Components: Refactor Header, Pricing Matrix, Reservation Button, and About/Gallery to match layout patterns from Julienne/Sopranos

📐 Layout: Use a 12-column grid system, max-w-[1200px], desktop-first design

🧭 Header: full-width, centered nav, sticky with background fade

💳 Pricing Matrix: 3-column, real data, hover-scale animation, no NaN

🍽️ Reserve CTA: sticky pill button (bottom right), warm gradient

🗂️ Who Are We / About: clear sectioning, visuals, CTA

🔄 Animation: Only use framer-motion if the project already supports it. Prefer Tailwind transition, hover, ease-in-out.

✅ Constraints
Do not use Framer Motion unless already included

Use Tailwind and component-based design (shadcn/ui v4 optional, not required)

Avoid overengineering — focus on clean, scalable HTML/JSX

The site should be desktop-first, then gracefully responsive for mobile

Correct all layout bugs (icon spacing, misaligned buttons, visual inconsistencies)

🧪 Deliverables
Fully functional and visually polished UI

Adheres strictly to Julienne/Sopranos aesthetic

All layout bugs fixed

Color system implemented in Tailwind or via CSS custom props

All sections match live references in structure and visual hierarchy
